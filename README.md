# SSM Workspace Dashboard

A bespoke, Next.js-powered management workspace designed for Support Staff Management. This dashboard acts as a centralized intelligence hub featuring live roster tracking, historical performance statistics, automated metric evaluation, and interactive task delegation.

This application uses a headless architecture, relying on Google Sheets as its primary database and the Discord API for automated team notifications.

---

## 🔗 Architecture & Connection Points

This application relies on two primary external connection points to function:

1. **Google Sheets API (The Database):** The application uses a Google Cloud Service Account to read and write data in real-time to a centralized Google Spreadsheet. Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is utilized to cache read requests for 60 seconds to prevent API rate-limiting.
2. **Discord API (The Notification Engine):** The application connects directly to a Discord Bot to dispatch automated pings to a designated management channel (specifically when tasks or metric exceptions are generated).

### Required Database (Google Sheets) Structure
The Google Sheet linked to this project **must** contain the following exact tab names for the application to map data correctly:
* `SSRoster` (Active/Inactive Support staff)
* `SSMRoster` (Management staff)
* `AllStats` (Master historical performance ledger)
* `ForumReports` (Raw output log for forum actions)
* `LOAs` (Leave of absence ledger)
* `SupportChangesLog` (Roster movement and rank changes)
* `SpokenToLogs` (Disciplinary and feedback records)
* `Tasks` (Active and completed action items)
* `TasksLog` (Permanent history of task creation/completion)
* `Scratchpad` (A single-cell tab holding the `Data` header for monthly stat staging)
